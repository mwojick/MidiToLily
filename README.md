## Convert a MIDI file to LilyPond format

MidiToLily is a Windows console application converts a MIDI file to LilyPond format. You can create sheet music from a MIDI file by using MidiToLily as a preprocessor for LilyPond. MidiToLily is an alternative to the midi2ly script that ships with LilyPond.

# Getting started

Download the latest release, unzip it, and run MidiToLily.exe. MidiToLily doesn't have an installer, doesn't have dependencies, and doesn't store things in the registry or anywhere else.

# Command line

For help, run the application with no arguments.

# Development

MidiToLily is written in C++ using MFC. It compiles cleanly in Visual Studio 2012 and 2019. MidiToLily does what I need it to do, but undoubtably could be improved.
